# To clone and use this repository:

```bash
sudo apt install imagemagick # or other package manager in your distro; imagemagick is also available on Windows.
git clone https://github.com/a3k55yearbook/src_compressed --depth=1
```

Remove `--depth=1` if you want to clone all commits ever (not really recommended tbh)
